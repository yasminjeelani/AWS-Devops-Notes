## Virtual Machine ðŸ’»
A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises). Software called a hypervisor separates the machineâ€™s resources from the hardware and provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the VM.
## Docker ðŸ¦ˆ
Docker is an open source containerization platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. It enables applications to package applications into containers that encapsulate source code, libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.
